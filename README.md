# *Pig Dice*

#### By **Chris Ramer**

## Description

Had a little extra fun with this lesson. I'm a game dev at heart so any time I make a game, I'm living the dream :)

## How to Play

Go [here](https://chrisramer.github.io/game-of-choice/) and specify your options and click "Play game!"

A brief overview of the CPU difficulties:
* Easy: Always holds after first roll
* Normal: 50/50 chance to either roll or hold
* Hard: Odds of holding increase with the more points CPU gets. Auto holds once they have enough points to win
* Impossible: Cheats and knows what roll it will get ahead of time, so never rolls 1s except on a first roll (kinda need to roll to do anything in this game :p)

You can set starting points values for yourself and CPU. This can act as a handicap or as a way to increase or shorten the lengeth of the game. For example, have both of you start at -100 points, then you will need 200 points to win. Give yourself a handicap of -50 points if you feel you're too pro for the CPU.
